    "We recommend installation using `conda` package manager. If you do not already have it installed, download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) Python 3+ for your operating system and follow the instructions to install it. After the installation is complete, in Terminal (Linux and MacOS) or in Anaconda Prompt (Windows), create a new conda environment and activate it. \n",

    "Some OOMMF extensions are not available on Windows. In order to use these extensions on Windows we recommend installing Docker - you can download it from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop. Ubermag will automatically recognise Docker and use it if required.
